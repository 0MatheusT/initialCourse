#This project presents my learning curve since begining.

------------------------------------------------//--------------------------------------------------

In the first time I've used to knowledge about git to make the structure's repository and the work-
flow.
I choose git-flow as a workflow for this.
I've created the sctructures of files and folders to organize the project.
I've created the files index.html, script.js and style.css to base.

I hope u enjoy this project!
Follow me and see my growning.

Added the first step of learning. The JavaScript Fundamentals.
I decided divided the project into simple parts.
Each part will be a topic of learning and will have your respectives files, like modules.

The first topic has an Introdution to the Fundamental's JavaScript.
I use a simple page to write some instructions and in console was made some tests with 
the subjects learned.
