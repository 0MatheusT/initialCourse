#This project presents my learning curve since begining.
------------------------------------------------//--------------------------------------------------

In the first time I've used to knowledge about git to make the structure's repository and the work-
flow.
I choose git-flow as a workflow for this.
I've created the sctructures of files and folders to organize the project.
I've created the files index.html, script.js and style.css to base.

I hope u enjoy this project!
Follow me and see my growning.

reset the layout of project.
