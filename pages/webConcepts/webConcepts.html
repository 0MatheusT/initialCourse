        <h3>What's Internet?</h3>

        <p>
          The Internet is essentially a global network of computing resources. You can think of the
          Internet as a physical collection of routers and circuits as a set of shared resources.
          <br>
          Some common definitions given in the past include:
          <ul>
            <li>A network of networks based on the TCP/IP communications protocol.</li>
            <li>A community of people who use and develop those networks.</li>
          </ul> 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h3>What's TCP/IP?</h3>

        <p>
          TCP/IP, or the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication
          protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as
          a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or an extranet).
          <br>
          TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end 
          communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted,
          routed and received at the destination. TCP/IP requires little central management, and it 
          is designed to make networks reliable, with the ability to recover automatically from the
          failure of any device on the network.

        <h3>Internet-Based Services</h3>
          Some of the basic services available to Internet users are:
          <br>
        <strong> Email</strong>  A fast, easy, and inexensive way to communicate with other Internet
         users around the world. <br>
        <strong>Telnet </strong> Allows a user to log into a remote comuter as though it were a
        local system. <br>
        <strong>FT</strong>  Allows a user to transfer virtually every kind of file that can be 
        stored on a comuter from one Internet-connected comuter to another. <br>
        <strong>UseNet news </strong> A distributed bulletin board that offers a combination news 
        and discussion service on thousands of toics. <br>
        <strong>World Wide Web (WWW) </strong>  A hyertext interface to Internet information
        resources.
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h3>What's HTTP?</h3>
        <p>
          HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is the protocol being used to transfer 
          hypertext documents that makes the World Wide Web possible.
          <br>
          A standard web address such as Yahoo.com is called a URL and here the prefix http 
          indicates its protocol

      <div class="block">
        <h3>What's Web Server?</h3>
        <p>
          Every Website sits on a computer known as a Web server. This server is always connected 
          to the internet. Every Web server that is connected to the Internet is given a unique 
          address made up of a series of four numbers between 0 and 256 separated by periods. 
          For example, 68.178.157.132 or 68.122.35.127.
          <br>
          When you register a Web address, also known as a domain name, such as tutorialspoint.com
          you have to specify the IP address of the Web server that will host the site.
        </p>

        <h3>What's Web Browser?</h3>
        <p>
          Web Browsers are software installed on your PC. To access the Web you need a web browsers,
          such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.
          <br>
          Currently you must be using any sort of Web browser while you are navigating through my
          site tutorialspoint.com. On the Web, when you navigate through pages of information this
          is commonly known as browsing or surfing.
        </p>

      <div class="block">
        <h3>What's DNS?</h3>
        <p>
          DNS stands for Domain Name System. When someone types in your domain name, www.example.com,
          your browser will ask the Domain Name System to find the IP that hosts your site. When you
          registeryour domain name, your IP address should be put in a DNS along with your domain
          name. Without doing it your domain name will not be functioning properly.

        <h3>What's HTML, CSS and JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>HTML</strong>
            provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other
            technologies like CSS and JavaScript. HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless
            the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for
            any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content
            for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn. <br>

            <strong>CSS</strong>
            is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. CSS stands for Cascading Style 
            Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should 
            actually appear on the frontend of the page.<br>
            
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>
            is used to control the behavior of different elements. JavaScript is a logic-based 
            programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in 
            different ways in response to a user's actions. Common uses for JavaScript include 
            confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new identities to existing information.

            In short, JavaScript is a programming language that lets web developers design 
            interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to 
            
            JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.<br>
